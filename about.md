My name is [Henrik Lau Eriksson](http://henrik.laueriksson.com) and I live in Stockholm, Sweden.

I'm a programmer with focus on _[.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) / ASP.NET / C#_

I enjoy writing quality code and try my best to practice _TDD / BDD / [Specification by Example](https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/)_

_Web / Cloud / [Serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/serverless-computing/)_ are some of the things I find interesting

This blog is my tool to become a better developer. I write about the things I learn, the things I find exciting and the things I want my future self to remember.
