This is how I created this blog with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and put it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You can browse the repo at [https://github.com/hlaueriksson/conductofcode.io](https://github.com/hlaueriksson/conductofcode.io)

## Jekyll

After [installing Jekyll]({% post_url 2016-01-16-setting-up-jekyll-on-windows %}) you can create a new blog with the command:

`jekyll new <path>`

Take a look at the Quick-start Instructions on [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information.

If you don't like the command line, consider using [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/).

Update these files with your own content:

* _config.yml
* about.md

My configuration ended up like this:

{% gist hlaueriksson/ba2318c1a3f6ce57dd2e _config.yml %}

I added Google Analytics and changed the [permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) to my liking.

The `jekyll-sitemap` and `jekyll-gist` gems are also nice features to add.

Consider adding these files:

* 404.md
* favicon.png
* robots.txt

GitHub Pages supports [custom 404 pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site/).

A `robots.txt` file may contain a link to the sitemap, generated by the `jekyll-sitemap` gem.

## GitHub Pages

Create a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and push your Jekyll files to a `gh-pages` branch, if you are using a project site. Refer to the documentation on [Jekyll GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) for more information.

Get yourself a domain and add a `CNAME` file to the root of the repo.

My `CNAME` file for this blog looks like this:

{% highlight txt %}
conductofcode.io
{% endhighlight %}

Then refer to the documentation about [using a custom domain with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).

In my case I followed the instructions for [configuring `A` records with your DNS provider](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider).

Then it should only be a matter of time until your domain begins to resolve to your Jekyll site on GitHub Pages.

## Integrations

Smashing Magazine had a great article about [Static Website Generators](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/).

I have decided not to include comments on the site, yet. Should I?
