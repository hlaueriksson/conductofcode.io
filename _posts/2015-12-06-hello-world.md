I intend to start blogging. About programming. Never Stop Learning. Continuous improvement. This is the things I learn along the way.

As [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx) puts it:

> Every developer should have a blog

I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), just like [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/).
